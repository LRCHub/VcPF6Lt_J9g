Get up there boys
You've got a mission to do
The future it waits in the balance
You've got nothing to lose

Breathing fire
Hell at your door
Pray and curse for survival
Still got something to prove
Nothin' to lose no more

Summer rain will come
Winter winds will blow
The world keeps turnin' 'round and 'round
Still you'll never know

No need to unpack
You won't be stayin' long
The tomorrow you search for
Is just outside your door

Breathing fire
Hell at your door
Pray and curse for survival
Still got something to prove
Nothin' to lose no more

Summer rain will come
Winter winds will blow
The world keeps turnin' 'round and 'round
Still you'll never know

All these broken toys
Sometimes you've got to bend
Four seasons will bring on the changes
Broken windows will mend

Breathing fire
Hell at your door
Pray and curse for survival
Still got something to prove
Nothin' to lose no more

Summer rain will come
Winter winds will blow
The world keeps turnin' 'round and 'round
Still you never know
