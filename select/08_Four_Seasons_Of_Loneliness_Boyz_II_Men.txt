Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh, yea, uh-uh-uh, yeah
Oh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh
I long for, the warmth of, days gone by when you were mine
But now those days, are memories in time
Life's empty, without you, by my side
My heart belongs to you, no matter what I try

When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love, as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes it's way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume
And I will miss you in summertime

When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare
When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same (doesn't feel the same)

Remember, the nights when, we closed our eyes
And vowed that you and I would be in love for all time
Anytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional (I get so emotional)
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love, as I watch four seasons change

In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes it's way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume
The scent of your perfume when summer burns

When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do (we used to do)
When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare
When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same (doesn't feel the same)

This loneliness has crushed my heart
Please let me love again
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring, the loneliness again

In comes the winter breeze that chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes it's way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume
The scent of your perfume when summer burns
When summer burns with heat, I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves, the trees are bare
When you're not here, it doesn't feel the same
Remember (remember) the warmth, of days gone by
