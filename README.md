Some days you're hot as July
Sometimes you're cold as the wintertime
But no matter the weather (Don't matter),
thought this was forever
I'm here 365
You say I'll never come to the city no more
What's the point of going uptown
if you're never uptown?
You've been gettin' around
I can't even take it no more,
you ain't save it up for me
Bringing up what I do,
but you can't do what I do
'Cause you ain't did what I did
Bought you new whips,
bought you watches
You had one job,
so what your job is?
Just stick to one...,
is that so hard? (Shh)
You say I'll never come to the city no more
I can't even take it no more
Some days you're hot as July, yeah
Sometimes you're cold as the wintertime
But no matter the weather (Don't matter),
thought this was forever
I'm here 365
You said you won't blame it on me
And I won't blame it on you
I be in my feelings in the nighttime
And start saying things that ain't true
I know I wasn't perfect, babe
Don't know why I expected perfect, babe
When I know I hurt you, babe
Still I wanted virtue, babe,
it's already been done
Took too long
But can you come over
and right these wrongs?
That's why I write these songs
Thinking maybe I can reach you, oh
Some days you're hot as July
(I can't reach you, oh)
Sometimes you're cold as the wintertime
But no matter the weather (Don't matter),
thought this was forever
I'm here 365
Some days you're hot as July, yeah
Sometimes you're cold as the wintertime
But no matter the weather (Don't matter),
thought this was forever
I'm here 365
